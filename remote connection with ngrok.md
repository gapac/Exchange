Yes, you can connect to your Raspberry Pi using only ngrok without setting up a full VPN. ngrok can expose your Raspberry Pi's SSH service securely over the internet. Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

Step 1: Set Up ngrok on Your Raspberry Pi
Sign Up for ngrok:
Visit the ngrok website and sign up for a free account.

Install ngrok:

sh
Copy code
wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-arm.zip
unzip ngrok-stable-linux-arm.zip
sudo mv ngrok /usr/local/bin/
Authenticate ngrok:
Retrieve your ngrok auth token from the ngrok dashboard, then run:

sh
Copy code
ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
Step 2: Expose SSH with ngrok
Start ngrok to Expose SSH:
Run the following command to start ngrok and expose the SSH port (22):

sh
Copy code
ngrok tcp 22
Note the Forwarding Address:
ngrok will provide a forwarding address like tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:XXXXX. This is the address you will use to SSH into your Raspberry Pi from a remote location.

Step 3: Connect to Your Raspberry Pi Remotely
Use SSH to Connect:
On your remote device, use the ngrok forwarding address to connect to your Raspberry Pi. The command will look something like this:
sh
Copy code
ssh -p XXXXX pi@0.tcp.ngrok.io
Replace XXXXX with the port number provided by ngrok and 0.tcp.ngrok.io with the actual address.
Example
Assuming ngrok provides the forwarding address tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345, the SSH command would be:

sh
Copy code
ssh -p 12345 pi@0.tcp.ngrok.io
Additional Tips
Persistent Tunnels: For persistent tunnels, consider using the ngrok.yml configuration file or the ngrok Pro plan, which allows for named tunnels.
Security: Ensure your Raspberry Pi’s SSH service is secure. Use strong passwords and consider using SSH key-based authentication.
